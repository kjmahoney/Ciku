##Welcome to Ciku
Ciku is an app for designed for studying Chinese language. It allows the user to create a deck, or category,
in which to store cards. Cards store a Chinese word or phrase, its translation, or pronunciation. Once a deck
is populated with cards, a user can utilize the quiz functionality to test their knowledge of the deck. cards
answered correctly in quiz mode, will be labeled 'learned' and incorrectly will be labeled 'not learned'. A user
can see the percentage of learned to not learned cards in each deck.

Ciku can be used for any language or topic. However, its styling and card fields are designed with the
Chinese language in mind. It is most compatible with languages not using the Roman alphabet. Ciku contains fields (i.e pronunciation) that are unnecessary for the learning of other topics. Additionally fields meant for characters may look strange when populated with alphabetic characters.
