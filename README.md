#Welcome to Ciku

##What is Ciku
Ciku is an application for studying languages and is especially tailored for Chinese. Ciku allows you to create decks of vocabulary cards and then to quiz yourself on each deck.

##Installation

##Implementing Three.js
I am excited to have included Three.js in the quiz functionality of Ciku. A 3D cube responds to whether the user answered a question correctly or not; specifically, spinning faster the more consecutive questions the user answers.

##Future Features
- [ ] Leverage external API so that translations auto-populate when making a new card
- [ ] Expand mastery functionality: Replace the boolean figure with a score system for each card
- [ ] User Authentication
- [ ] Support deck importation via csv
